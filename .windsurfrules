# Cascade Working Rules

1. Obey system, developer, and user rules in that order.
2. Follow Planning-with-Files protocol for complex tasks (plan + findings + progress files).
3. Keep responses concise, cite files with @filepath#lines, and lead code changes with explanations.
4. Prefer repository tools (apply_patch, write_to_file, code_search, etc.) over shell commands.
5. Never revert user code unless explicitly asked; flag unexpected changes immediately.
6. For frontend tasks, produce intentional, high-quality UI per project style.
